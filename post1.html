                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In today's society, while physical injuries have significantly decreased due to technological
                        advancements, the prevalence of mental illness is on the rise despite material abundance. The
                        increase in mental health challenges can be attributed to the diversification of living and
                        working environments, as well as changes in human relationships. Unfortunately, accessing
                        treatment for depression remains a challenge due to a lack of awareness about mental health
                        issues and the complexity of identifying their root causes.</p>

                    <p>According to a 2023 report by Mental Health America (MHA), in 2019-2020, approximately 20.78% of
                        adults in the United States were experiencing some form of mental illness, affecting over 50
                        million Americans. Additionally, more than 10% of youth in the U.S. are grappling with severe
                        depression, significantly impairing their functioning in school, work, family life, and social
                        activities. Alarmingly, 54.7% of adults and 59.8% of youth with major depression receive no
                        mental health treatment. Depression is not confined to a specific age group, underscoring the
                        need for improved access to treatment.</p>

                    <p>To address this issue, we propose the use of social robots as a cost-effective means to alleviate
                        depression, accessible to individuals of all ages. Our social robot consists of two main
                        components: emotional analysis and natural language interaction. The emotional analysis
                        component collects various data from users, including voice tone and facial expressions, to
                        perform multi-modal emotion analysis. Based on the emotional analysis, our social robot suggests
                        actions and engages in natural conversations using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance
                        users' mental well-being.</p>

                    <p>LLMs offer the advantage of more "natural" human-like conversations through natural language
                        processing. However, they may produce variable output formats, which can be challenging to
                        integrate into specific system structures. To address this, we employ prompt engineering
                        techniques to generate output that aligns with the structure of our proposed social robot
                        system.</p>

                    <p>Our social robot is designed as a software application, rather than a physical hardware robot
                        like a humanoid or pet robot. This choice is driven by two primary factors. First, we aim to
                        minimize production costs to ensure affordability for a wide audience. Physical robots would
                        substantially increase production expenses. Second, many depression-treatment social robots
                        focus predominantly on the physical aspect of the robot, neglecting intangible interactions such
                        as meaningful conversations with users. Our project prioritizes creating a robot that engages in
                        more natural and meaningful dialogues with users.</p>
                    <p>This innovative initiative leverages emotional analysis and LLM (Large Language Model) technology
                        to provide companionship and support to individuals facing psychological challenge.</p>
                    <p>Emotional well-being is a critical aspect of human life, and our project aims to address the
                        growing issue of loneliness and depression by creating a robot that can understand and respond
                        to human emotions. Through advanced algorithms and machine learning, our robot can provide
                        companionship, empathy, and assistance to those in need.</p>
                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <p>Our Social Robot uses cutting-edge emotional analysis software to interpret the emotional states
                        of its users. It can detect changes in voice tone, facial expressions, and even text messages to
                        gauge the user's emotional well-being. Based on this analysis, the robot responds with
                        appropriate actions and interactions.</p>
                    <p>Additionally,the robot uses LLM technology to provide solutions to respond to the multimodal
                        emotional analysis results it processes, enabling it to build meaningful and personalized
                        relationships with users over time.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">Loneliness and depression are significant challenges in today's
                        world. Our project aims to provide a solution that brings companionship and support to those who
                        need it most.</blockquote>
                    <h2>The Future of Emotional Support</h2>
                    <p>We believe that the integration of emotional analysis and LLM technology in our Social Robot
                        represents the future of emotional support systems. With the ability to adapt and grow alongside
                        its users, our robot can offer genuine companionship and a listening ear to anyone experiencing
                        emotional difficulties.</p>
